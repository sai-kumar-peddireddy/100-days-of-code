# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 30, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Learned about prime numbers in GFG Data Structures course.

**Thoughts:** Today is my first day of the challenge I wanted to do it from long back so finally, I am doing it now.

**Link to work:** 

[Prime Number method 1](https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/OOi0HEn8Ax) Naive method

[Prime Number method 2](https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/tE5NB3Zvb7) Optimized with Sqrt


### Day 1: October 1, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: continued Learned about prime numbers checking and prime factorization in GFG Data Structures course.

**Thoughts:** Because of commitment, started reading don't have the mood to study because woke up at 6:00 AM but learned a little bit about  optimising the previous solution

**Link to work:** 

[Prime Number method 3](https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/vcVp5vTbX5) More optimization by adding a check if divisible by 2 and 3

[Prime Number factor generation 1](https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/8tv3XnVKNV) Naive method
