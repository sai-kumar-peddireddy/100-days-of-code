# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 30, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Learned about prime numbers in GFG Data Structures course.

**Thoughts:** Today is my first day of the challenge I wanted to do it from long back so finally, I am doing it now.

**Link to work:** 

[Prime Number method 1](https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/OOi0HEn8Ax) Naive method

[Prime Number method 2](https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/tE5NB3Zvb7) Optimized with Sqrt


### Day 1: October 1, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: continued Learned about prime numbers checking and prime factorization in GFG Data Structures course.

**Thoughts:** Because of commitment, started reading don't have the mood to study because woke up at 6:00 AM but learned a little bit about  optimising the previous solution

**Link to work:** 

[Prime Number method 3](https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/vcVp5vTbX5) More optimization by adding a check if divisible by 2 and 3

[Prime Number factor generation 1](https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/8tv3XnVKNV) Naive method

### Day 2: October 2, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Learned about divisors, prime numbers
and power of a number 

**Thoughts:** Today I spent more time because of office holyday. I feel that almost most of problems are sharing some part of solution common If I learn to solve one problem that is helping to think other problems with same pattern

### Day 3: October 3, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: solving problems on Prime numbers and geometric progression

**Thoughts:** Today I spent time on solving problems on topics learned, I am failed to solve one problem I will do it.

[GP Term](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/gp-term/1/)

### Day 4: October 4, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Solving problems on divisors.

**Thoughts:** Today I spent time on solving a problem finding numbers which has exactly 3 divisors.Today I have't spend much time on studing.

[Exactly 3 Divisors ](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/exactly-3-divisors/1/)

### Day 5: October 5, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Solving same problem on divisors.

**Thoughts:** Tried the solution using hints not able to do it, finally seen the solution.
I am not able to recall the old solutions to match with the current one. I observe that to solve a problem we must apply all previous learning techniques to it.
